### High Level Description 
A Higher or lower card game based around playing cards being the aesthetic, allowing a user to be given a card or value then guessing whether the next value will be higher or lower in conjunction or comparision to the initial value. If the user is correct in their assumption they are to be visual awarded somehow or notified whether they were right or wrong.

### Algorithm - (Flowchart)

### Process of implementation Algorithm

The HTML page was first developed, whilst a canvas was thereafter defined, then another square was defined within the canvas. Furthermore the mouse was is then required to be tracked on the screen to the canvas, whilst the cords of the square are also needed to be retrieved. The cords then need to be compared minus or adding onto the cords of the square if certain conditions are met, including a timer to ensure that the square movement is smooth and doesnt look like its teleporting around or about the page or screen. Inaddition the square and mouse then need to have a defined area or set cords or x and y with a conditional statement comparing them seeing whether the cords are eqaul or enroach on one another.Moreover adding at the end of the statement to minus lives, creating or defining a lives variable where if there is collision a life or numerical value is subtracted or taken away from the variable. While the code is held or indented within a loop where if certain conditions are met i.e: the user runs out of lives or the variable lives hits a certain defined numerical value the game ends.

### Description of IDE used and features it provided

The IDE ( Integrated Development Environment) used was notepad, though notepad is a questionable IDE as it has no redefining features and doesnt provide any comprehensive facilities except an area to write code and save the file in relation to the type of code written.

### Debugging process and debugging facilities in your chosen IDE

The IDE or notepad does not have any debugging facilities,but the debugging proccess has to be done manually either scrolling through code to locate and fix the problem or using preset code that is indented into the program and debugs the code, finding the problem for it to be solved (fixed).
