### High Level Description 
A Higher or lower card game based around playing cards being the aesthetic, allowing a user to be given a card or value then guessing whether the next value will be higher or lower in conjunction or comparision to the initial value. If the user is correct in their assumption they are to be visual awarded somehow or notified whether they were right or wrong.

### Algorithm - (Flowchart)

### Process of implementation Algorithm

The program was initially broken down into segments, the first proccess consisitng of getting a random number

### Description of IDE used and features it provided

The IDE ( Integrated Development Environment) used was notepad, though notepad is a questionable IDE as it has no redefining features and doesnt provide any comprehensive facilities except an area to write code and save the file in relation to the type of code written.

### Debugging process and debugging facilities in your chosen IDE

The IDE or notepad does not have any debugging facilities,but the debugging proccess has to be done manually either scrolling through code to locate and fix the problem or using preset code that is indented into the program and debugs the code, finding the problem for it to be solved (fixed).
